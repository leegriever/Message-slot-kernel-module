# Message-slot-kernel-module
This is an implementation of a kernel module that provides a new inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism, called a message slot. It is a character device file through which processes communicate. In this project, I gained experience with kernel programming and a better understanding of IPC, kernel modules and drivers.
